This is a powershell script that can take any image and render it to the PowerShell commandline, pixel by pixel. Most command lines are 120 columns by default so you want a picture that's smaller than that.

You can just run the included reddit-drawing.ps1 or use the DrawPicture.ps1 file to draw any picture you like.

Enjoy.
