This is a powershell script that can take any image and render it to the PowerShell commandline, pixel by pixel. Most command lines are 120 columns by default so you want a picture that's smaller than that.

You can just run the included reddit-drawing.ps1 or use the DrawPicture.ps1 file to draw any picture you like. Use the DrawPicture.ps1 file by typing:

 	.\DrawPicture.ps1 .\picture.png
  
  or

	.\DrawPicture.ps1 -path C:\full\path\picture.png

Enjoy.
